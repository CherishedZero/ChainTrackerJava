Welcome to the Pokemon Infinite Fusion PokeRadar Chain Tracker for Randomized Mode.

Reason this project was created:
We determined that the PokeRadar is deterministic when using randomized settings in PIF, so this program was created to allow us to track our chains to keep track of available pokemon.

Functions:
Adding links with starting pokemon, next pokemon, and location that started the link.
Display all available links in the data.
Adjust existing links if information is inaccurate or if more locations for existing chains is located.
Removal of links.
Display a list of all available chains.
Display all locations where links can be started and which pokemone are available at that route.
Find all chains that lead to a selected pokemon.
