<h1>Welcome to the Pokemon Infinite Fusion PokeRadar Chain Tracker for Randomized Mode.</h1><br>
<h3>Reason this project was created:</h3><br>
We determined that the PokeRadar is deterministic when using randomized settings in PIF, so this program was created to allow us to track our chains to keep track of available pokemon.<br>
<br>
<h3>Functions:</h3><br>
Adding links with starting pokemon, next pokemon, and location that started the link.<br>
Display all available links in the data.<br>
Adjust existing links if information is inaccurate or if more locations for existing chains is located.<br>
Removal of links.<br>
Display a list of all available chains.<br>
Display all locations where links can be started and which pokemone are available at that route.<br>
Find all chains that lead to a selected pokemon.<br>
